# Thesis Test Results

For transparency purposes and to maximize the benefit of my thesis work to the security community, we have added a GitHub repository that includes the detailed results we achieved for each scanner. This repository also includes the database file / session snapshop / report for each scan so that the interested user can independently verify the results we obtained.

A link to the thesis report will be included here when it becomes available.
