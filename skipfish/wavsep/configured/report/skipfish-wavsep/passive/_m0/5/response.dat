<H2>Setting a cookie without the HTTPOnly flag (Originally part of ZAP-WAVE)</H2>
<H3>Description</H3>
The 'info-cookie-no-http-only' cookie is set without the HTTPOnly flag being set.<br>
This means that the cookie can be accessed by client side scripts, which is usually a bad idea.<br>
Note that some servers may add this flag anyway, depending on their configuration!
